Word-Sense-Synset is done. Verb frames and syntactic info are completely unimplemented.

Longer-term ideas:

* Use Jake
    - Add task to download SQL WordNet version from https://sourceforge.net/projects/wnsql/
* Configure DB models location in one place
* Configure DB dialect (downloading and connecting)
* Integrate more DBs: http://sqlunet.sourceforge.net/
* Auto-generate GraphQL code from DBs?
* Which data is many-to-one, one-to-one, etc? http://wnsql.sourceforge.net/uml2.html
